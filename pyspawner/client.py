class Client:
    """
    Launch Python quickly, sharing most memory pages.

    The problem this solves: we want to spin up many children quickly; but as
    soon as a child starts running we can't trust it. Starting Python with lots
    of imports like Pyarrow+Pandas can take ~2s and cost ~100MB RAM.

    The solution: a mini-server process, the "pyspawner", preloads Python
    modules. Then we clone() each time we need a subprocess. (clone() is
    near-instantaneous.) Beware: since clone() copies all memory, the
    "pyspawner" shouldn't load anything sensitive before clone(). (No Django:
    it reads secrets!)

    This is similar to Python's multiprocessing.forkserver, except...:

    * Children are not managed. It's up to the caller to kill and wait for the
      process. Children are direct children of the _caller_, not of the
      pyspawner. (We use CLONE_PARENT.)
    * asyncio-safe: we don't listen for SIGCHLD, because asyncio's
      subprocess-management routines override the signal handler.
    * Thread-safe: multiple threads may spawn multiple children, and they may
      all run concurrently (unless child code writes files or uses networking).
    * No `multiprocessing.context`. This Client is the context.
    * No `Connection` (or other high-level constructs).
    * The caller interacts with the pyspawner process via _unnamed_ AF_UNIX
      socket, rather than a named socket. (`multiprocessing` writes a pipe
      to /tmp.) No messing with hmac. Instead, we mess with locks. ("Aren't
      locks worse?" -- [2019-09-30, adamhooper] probably not, because clone()
      is fast; and multiprocessing and asyncio have a race in Python 3.7.4 that
      causes forkserver children to exit with status code 255, so their
      named-pipe+hmac approach does not inspire confidence.)
